 <h3> How Do You Go About Securing Your Internet? </h3>
    <p>The first thing we advise you to do is to purchase internet security software and downloaded on to your devices. Some of the most known companies are Norton, McAfee, and Kaspersky. ( Check out the links on the More Info page to find the best deals for you.) Another thing you can do is make sure you are using secure webpages.  The key is to look for the green lock before the url.This a great way to protect yourself, especially from viruses. Last but not leaste, if you have wifi in your house, secure it with a strong password. The more you use a password, the more likely you are susceptible you are to being hacked.
